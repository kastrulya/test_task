#### Installing

1. Clone the repository.
2. CD into the repo.
3. Run `npm install`. This installs all of Vue's dependencies.
4. Run `composer install`. This installs all of Laravel's dependencies.
5. Run `php artisan serve`. This serves the application to the browser. You can also use Homestead, LAMP, WAMP, etc.
6. In a new tab/window, run `npm run watch` in the same directory.
This compiles your Vue resources, and automaticly runs whenever you save a file.
You can also use `npm run build` to do a one-time build of your javascript assets.
